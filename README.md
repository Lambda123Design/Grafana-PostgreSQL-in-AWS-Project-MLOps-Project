**Project Title** - **Transaction Fraud Detection System for Credit Cards (Using Rule Based Logic)**

**Project Working:**

In this Project, I have used Grafana as a monitoring and visualization tool to create dashboard (To track and analyze data)

**Project Explanation** - In this project, I have worked for building a transaction fraud detection system for credit cards using rule-based logic, categorizing transactions into dispute, real-time, and settlement types. In this project,the system applies predefined rules to decide whether to accept or reject each transaction. The data and decisions are stored and visualized using Grafana dashboards, which are set up by connecting to PostgreSQL hosted on AWS, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis of transaction fraud patterns.
